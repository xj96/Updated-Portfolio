Assignment: Updated Portfolio

Description: Updated version of my portfolio including links to web pages I have worked on and collaborated on. 

DISCLAIMER: Project 2 is still in the works. I will link the finished website on my portfolio page. For now I added in a picture and updated the descriptions on the previous projects.

Plans for the future: I am planning to do a major overhaul of the website. 
- I plan to change the layout of the pages.
- The overall aesthetic of the portfolio site.
- I am going to delete the form on the contact page and instead use a mailto link so people don't have to use a redundant form submission to email me.
- I am going to add a design portfolio page and change the original portfolio page to a web development portfolio page.
